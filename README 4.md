2. For this solution to store previous solutions I used two pointers to help traverse and keep our location in both strings. 

3. Following the methodologies to come up with a solution I took a slight different approach because I thought about the problem iteratively and then tried to turn that into a recursive approach. I traverse both strings utilizing two pointers recursively and compare the characters. To try to break the code I used tests such as where the strings were already te same and where they added to the same ascii value.
