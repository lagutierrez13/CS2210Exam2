# CS2210Exam2

2. For this solution I am using a helper method to help determine if the substrings are actually palindromes, this is to help clear up the code in my main solution. I am using 3 variables, two of them to keep track of the beginning and end of the substrings and another to keep the total count of the substrings that are palindromic.

3. Following the methodologies to come up with a solution to the problem the first thing that I did was figuring out what I had to do which was basically just seeing if strings were palindromes but also all those strings would be substrings of other strings and that thought helped me understand how I had to break up the problem. I made sure I could determine if a string was a palindrome and then recursively applied that same method as I traversed the string for substrings. In the end I realized just how much easier the solution was than when I initially read the problem.
