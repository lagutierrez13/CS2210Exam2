2. For this solution to store previous solutions I used a variable prevTotal. When the number of sequences gets extended I add the previous number of sequences to the new one.

3. Following the methodologies to come up with a solution to the problem the first thing that I did was understand the smallest instance of the problem which was making sure that two sequences had the same difference. Then it was a matter of adding numbers to the entry and as the sequence got bigger, apply that same principle and check that it also matched the rest of the string. I tried to break my code with edge cases, like empty lists and negative numbers.
