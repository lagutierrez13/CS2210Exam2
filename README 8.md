2. For this solution to store previous solutions I used a list dp for base case entries. 

3. Following the methodologies to come up with a solution I first solved the problem using recursion without saving the values. I then realized that I was doing a lot of the same calculations and I could just stop doing that by storing the results to the subproblems in a list.
