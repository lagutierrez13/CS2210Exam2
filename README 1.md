2. For this solution to store previous solutions I store the solution array in the array s. In here I compute the all the solutions for the rows and pick the minimum value from the last row which gives me the output value.

3. Following the methodologies to come up with a solution to the problem the first thing that I did was determine what the recursive case for the problem was which in this case is accessing the spaces that are neighboring. I relaized my goal was to transform the values in A into the new values in s and from there get the smallest value as my output.
